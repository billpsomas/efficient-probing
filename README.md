**TL;DR:** We introduce efficient probing (EP), a simplified multi-query cross-attention mechanism, enhancing evaluation of self-supervised learning models by improving speed, performance, and interpretability.

## Overview

As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning (SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization and poor computational efficiency. 

In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and achieves up to a 10 $\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head attention. 

Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings.

## Experiments

### Evaluating MAE ViT-B with Efficient Probing on ImageNet-1k:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --nnodes=1 \
    main_linprobe.py --amp bfloat16 --num_workers=12 --dataloader_affinity_hack \
    --epochs=90 --accum_iter=1 --optimizer=lars --batch_size=1024 \
    --model vit_base_patch16  --finetune vit_base_patch16_224.mae \
    --dataset_name imagenet1k --nb_classes 1000 --data_path /mnt/data/Public_datasets/imagenet/imagenet_pytorch \
    --output_dir /home/psomava1/code/beyond_cls/outputs/linprobe_mae_vitb_ep_imagenet1k \
    --cls_features=ep
```

- To perform standard linear probing (**LP**):
  - Use `--cls_features cls` to utilize the class token from the pre-trained model.
  - Use `--cls_features pos` to utilize the patch tokens (via global average pooling).

- To perform full finetuning (**FT**), use the `--finetuning` flag.

#### üéØ **More poolings, Please!**
- Supported attentive pooling methods (as described in the paper): `abmilp`, `simpool`, `clip`, `siglip`, `aim`, `ep`, `cbam`, `coca`, `cait`, `dinovit`, `jepa`, `dolg`, `cae`
  - These can be passed via the `--cls_features` argument.
  - Note: Appending the suffix `_all` to any pooling type (e.g., `ep_all`) will include both patch tokens and the class token as input to the selected attentive pooling. By default, only patch tokens are used.

#### :globe_with_meridians: **More datasets, Please!**
- Experiment with more datasets in any setup of your choice by adjusting the `--dataset_name`, `--nb_classes`, and `--data_path` arguments accordingly.
  - **Supported datasets**: *ImageNet-1k*, *Places365*, *CIFAR-100*, *StanfordCars*, *Food101*, *FGVCAircraft*, *SUN397*, *DTD*, *OxfordIIITPet*, *CUB200*

####  üõ†Ô∏è **More models, Please!**
- Try [CAPI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/capi/tree/main) and [DINOv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2) pre-trained models (from PyTorch Hub) by adjusting the `--model` argument based on their official repositories.  
  - The `--finetune` argument is **not needed** in this case.

- Try **SimMIM**, **BEiTv2**, and **iBOT** by passing the checkpoint path to the `--finetune` argument.  
  - Pretrained weights are provided via [Google Drive](#).

- Instructions on how to use pre-trained models from **OpenCLIP** are provided in the following subsection.

### Evaluating CLIP ViT-L (pre-trained by openai) with Efficient Probing on ImageNet-1k:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --nnodes=1 \
    main_linprobe.py --amp bfloat16 --num_workers=12 --dataloader_affinity_hack \
    --epochs=90 --accum_iter=1 --optimizer=lars --batch_size=1024 \
    --model ViT-L-14 --openclip_pretrain openai --openclip \
    --dataset_name imagenet1k --nb_classes 1000 --data_path /mnt/data/Public_datasets/imagenet/imagenet_pytorch \
    --output_dir /home/psomava1/code/beyond_cls/outputs/linprobe_clip_openai_vitl_ep_imagenet1k \
    --cls_features=ep
```
- To evaluate alternative pre-trained OpenCLIP models, adjust the `--model` and `--openclip_pretrain` arguments accordingly. Available combinations can be found in the [official OpenCLIP repository](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip).

    Example alternative:
    
    ```bash
    --model ViT-L-16-SigLIP-256 --openclip_pretrain webli --openclip
    ```
